Javascript Reduce Method at work
The HTML file contains a basic structure to load in the JavaScript file and call to a function called getPopulationByContinent().

The JS file contains an ES6 class that contains a constructor, which itself has an arbitrary data structure of geographical data, and some of the hierarchy levels have a population figure.  It also contains a placeholder for the getPopulationByContinent method.

Functionality is to process the geographical data and calculate total populations grouped by continent.  For example, Asia = 67625000.
